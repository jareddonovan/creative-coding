      <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
      <p>
        Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November
        1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles
        Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She
        was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation,
        and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a 
        result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a 
        "computing machine" and one of the first computer programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Lady 
        Byron. All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women.
        Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever 
        four months later. He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, "Is thy face 
        like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?". He 
        died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her 
        mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an 
        effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this,
        Ada remained interested in Byron and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him
        at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies 
        assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 
        1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.

        Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as
        Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author
        Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her
        approach as "poetical science" and herself as an "Analyst (&amp; Metaphysician)".
      </p>
      <p>
        When she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working 
        relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, also 
        known as "the father of computers", and in particular, Babbage's work on the 
        Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend,
        and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi 
        Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes,
        simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer
        program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other 
        historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from 
        the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine. Lovelace's notes 
        are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision of the 
        capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many
        others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her 
        mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine 
        (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as
        a collaborative tool.

        She died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.
